NAME
====

ucm2ltc - convert a UCM file to an LTC source

SYNOPSIS
========

ucm2ltc [_OPTIONS_...] ([-c] [-i] [-n_NAME_] _FILE_...)

DESCRIPTION
===========

ucm2ltc converts a UCM description of a character set to the C source for
an LTC (LibTranscript Converter). The UCM description may contain several
extra constructs specific to ucm2ltc, described below.

OPTIONS
=======

ucm2ltc accepts the following options:

*-D*, *--dump*::
  Dump the input as a UCM description of the converter. Only the input files up
  to the first -c option are considered.
*-c*, *--concatenate*::
  When multiple input files are specified, ucm2ltc normally creates a
  single main converter, with several delta converters. This mode of operation is
  desirable when the specified input files are small variations, because it can
  save space. However, sometimes it is desirable to bunch a set of converters in
  a single LTC because the converters may be related, but not variations of a
  single converter. By specifying the -c option before an input file that
  is not a variation of the previous input file, ucm2ltc will treat the
  following input files as the specification of a separate converter, but will
  output a single LTC source file.
*-h*, *--help*::
  Display a short help message.
*-i*, *--internal*::
  Specify that the following input file is to be considered an internal
  converter, only to be used by another LTC module. A converter built with the
  -i flag can not be opened by clients of the libtranscript library, only by
  other LTC modules.
*-I*, *--allow-ibm-rotate*::
  Some UCM files provided by IBM map the Unicode characters U++001A, U++001C and
  U++007F to the output bytes 7F 1A and 1C respectively. This rotated mapping is
  IBM specific, and therefore ucm2ltc normally undoes this. However, in some
  instances it is desirable to keep this rotated mapping. This option instructs
  ucm2ltc to keep the rotated mapping intact.
*-n* _name_, *--name*=_name_::
  Set the name of the converter to _name_. Normally the name of the input
  file is taken as the name of the converter (without the .ucm extension).
*-o* _output_, *--output*=_output_::
  Write the output to _output_. If not specified, the input file name is
  used, with the .ucm extension replaced with .c. This option is required if more
  than one input file is provided.
*-v*, *--verbose*::
  Produce verbose output to standard error. Specifiy this option multiple times
  to increase verbosity.

To stop ucm2ltc from interpreting file names that start with a dash as
options, one can specify a double dash (--) after which ucm2ltc will
interpret any following arguments as files to read.

UCM EXTENSIONS
==============

ucm2ltc accepts several extensions to the basic UCM file format:

- In the UCM header, the <transcript:internal> tag is accepted to indicate that
  this converter is only to be used as an internal converter. This has the same
  effect as the -i option.
- M:N mappings can be included in the main CHARMAP, and do not have to be
  separated into the second CHARMAP entry.
- After the main CHARMAP, delta maps can be included by using
  VARIANT [INTERNAL] <name> ... END VARIANT. If delta maps are included, the main
  CHARMAP is not included as a converter. Only the delta converters are available
  in the LTC. To include the CHARMAP as a separate entry, include an empty delta
  map.

BUGS
====

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of libtranscript <http://os.ghalkes.nl/libtranscript.html>. When
reporting bugs, please include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.
