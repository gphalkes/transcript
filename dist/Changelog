Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Added dependency on Pthreads, to allow threading to work properly in all
	  circumstances.
	- Removed auto-initialization, because it was not providing the benefits
	  that were envisaged. Now the library requires calling of transcript_init
	  before any other function.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release
