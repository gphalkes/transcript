Version 0.2.4:
	Bug fixes:
	- Avoid assuming that the first argument of the compare function used for
	  lfind is the key.

Version 0.2.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Correct naming of UTF-8 with BOM in compiled name list (is now correctly
	  listed as X-UTF-8-BOM). This allows the UTF-8 with BOM converter to be
	  loaded.

Version 0.2.2:
	New features:
	- Allow finalizing of the library, to allow release of all memory for
	  debugging purposes.
	- Use dlopen/dlsym/dlclose directly if available, instead of using libltdl.

Version 0.2.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix handling of private use handling in unicode to unicode conversions,
	  such that it is in line with the other converters.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- Added dependency on Pthreads, to allow threading to work properly in all
	  circumstances.
	- Removed auto-initialization, because it was not providing the benefits
	  that were envisaged. Now the library requires calling of transcript_init
	  before any other function.

Version 0.1.1:
	Initial release
