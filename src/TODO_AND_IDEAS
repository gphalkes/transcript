- interface should have flags for
	- allowing fallbacks, including (and perhaps separately) fullwidth to
	  halfwidth fallbacks
- perhaps an iconv like A to B convertor with better semantics and better
  performance (through multiple conversions at a time) should be provided as
  well

- minimum buffer sizes should be specified for M:N conversions
- iso-2022-*, lmb, scsu, [bocu-1 PATENTED]

- proper testing of all the convertors!!! This means both correct and
  incorrect input!
- proper API definition with macros etc, and using a leading underscore
  for internal symbols
