	- allowing fallbacks, including (and perhaps separately) fullwidth to
	  halfwidth fallbacks
- perhaps an iconv like A to B convertor with better semantics and better
  performance (through multiple conversions at a time) should be provided as
  well

- minimum buffer sizes should be specified for M:N conversions
- [bocu-1 PATENTED], lmb, scsu, iso-2022-*, gb-18030

- proper testing of all the convertors!!! This means both correct and
  incorrect input!
