- interface should have flags for
	- allowing fallbacks, including (and perhaps separately) fullwidth to
	  halfwidth fallbacks
- perhaps an iconv like A to B convertor with better semantics and better
  performance (through multiple conversions at a time) should be provided as
  well

- the list of names returned by charconv_get_names should include all available
  names. This means that it should list the db dir and provide all names from
  there (if an alias is not already available). The question is whether we
  should probe each alias before putting it in the display list.

- iso-2022-*, lmb, scsu, [bocu-1 PATENTED]

- proper testing of all the convertors!!! This means both correct and
  incorrect input!

- map FFFD to subchar!
- private use handling in the unicode convertor! Should private use chars
  be allowed, and what interaction should be used wrt CHARCONV_ALLOW_PRIVATE_USE
- need formats which force endianess and use of BOM for UTF-16/32
- can we handle IBM PUA and apple PUA such that we somehow know where the
  private use stuff came from? If so, we can handle the whole
  CHARCONV_ALLOW_PRIVATE_USE differently
- we should modify convertors.txt to indicate the different variants
- convertors.txt sometimes heaps things that are not exactly the same.
  We should figure out if we can split those to do a proper difference.
  With the variant selection mechanism, this should not cause a large
  increase in size.
