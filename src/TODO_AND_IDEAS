- interface should have flags for
	- allowing fallbacks, including (and perhaps separately) fullwidth to halfwidth fallbacks
- a skip function to skip the next character which has been replaced manually
- minimum buffer sizes should be specified for M:N conversions
- flags must be present to indicate desire for BOM/acceptance of BOM and
	to indicate the end of the buffer
- implementation: a copy of the state should be made after each full conversion
	such that when we decide we need more data from the user, we can simply
	revert to the saved state
