HIGH PRIORITY
=============
- proper testing of all the convertors!!! This means both correct and
  incorrect input!
- private use handling in the unicode convertor! Should private use chars
  be allowed, and what interaction should be used wrt TRANSCRIPT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_USE
- need formats which force endianess and use of BOM for UTF-16/32
- aliases.txt should be updated to reflect the state of affairs according to
  me.
- provide a Makefile for the ibm ucm files, which bunches similar convertors
  into a single cct
- use pthread-stubs compile in dist Makefile [glibc provides the required
  stubs, but should compile with `pkg-config --cflags pthread-stubs`]
- provide pkg-config stuf for our own library
- add documentation

MEDIUM PRIORITY
===============
- add an interface to get the fallback character for a specific sequence
  encountered in the input. This interface can have one of two forms:
  - a flag which indicates that if a fallback is encoutered, it should be
    appended to the current output, but with the output ptr at the normal
	position (so it is added after the normal output)
  - a function to retrieve the character. The latter is obviously the most
    clean interface (least hacky), but is less efficient, and likely duplicates
	some code.
  In both cases, we actually have to convert the bytes we find to a unicode
  character. To do this, we have to
  - figure out which starting state the target bytes use
  - save the current convertor state.to
  - set the convertor state.to to the required one for converting the target
  - convert the target to unicode
  - restore the convertor state.to
  - return the found unicode state
  However, we can also simply provide a short list in each convertor indicating
  which fallbacks there are. Then we can do a binary search on that and return
  that value. Those are the overrides only, because for the general ones we
  don't include anything.
- iso-2022-*, lmb, scsu, [bocu-1 PATENTED]
- the aliases file is in ASCII, but the system on which we are running may not
  be! This means the aliases file should be converted to the current execution
  charset before use.

LOW PRIORITY
============
- perhaps an iconv like A to B convertor with better semantics and better
  performance (through multiple conversions at a time) should be provided as
  well

IDEAS/MISC
==========
- See http://x0213.org/codetable/index.en.html
  official standard (in japanese) http://www.jisc.go.jp/app/pager?id=72545
- It would be nice if we could remove the pthreads stuff, and note which
  functions are not thread safe. However, in doing so we need to consider that
  other libraries may use the library. This complicates matters, as the other
  library needs to share a locking mechanism with its users.

  [Sepcial attention should be given to transcript_squash_name. Best option: make
  transcript_init compulsory, and mark transcript_init and
  transcript_{open,close}_convertor as not thread-safe.]

RELEASE ENGINEERING
===================
- testing for
	- HAS_INLINE
	- HAS_NL_LANGINFO
	- HAS_STRDUP
	- USE_ENDIAN
	- USE_GETTEXT (don't forget to set LOCALEDIR! see dwdiff Makefile.dist.in)
- provide translations
- set the copyright years correctly
