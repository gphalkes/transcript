HIGH PRIORITY
=============
- proper testing of all the converters!!! This means both correct and
  incorrect input!
- aliases.txt should be updated to reflect the state of affairs according to
  me.
- provide pkg-config stuf for our own library

MEDIUM PRIORITY
===============
- add an interface to get the fallback character for a specific sequence
  encountered in the input. This interface can have one of two forms:
  - a flag which indicates that if a fallback is encoutered, it should be
    appended to the current output, but with the output ptr at the normal
	position (so it is added after the normal output)
  - a function to retrieve the character. The latter is obviously the most
    clean interface (least hacky), but is less efficient, and likely duplicates
	some code.
  In both cases, we actually have to convert the bytes we find to a unicode
  character. To do this, we have to
  - figure out which starting state the target bytes use
  - save the current converter state.to
  - set the converter state.to to the required one for converting the target
  - convert the target to unicode
  - restore the converter state.to
  - return the found unicode state
  However, we can also simply provide a short list in each converter indicating
  which fallbacks there are. Then we can do a binary search on that and return
  that value. Those are the overrides only, because for the general ones we
  don't include anything.
- iso-2022-*, lmb, scsu, [bocu-1 PATENTED], iscii
- the aliases file is in ASCII, but the system on which we are running may not
  be! This means the aliases file should be converted to the current execution
  charset before use.
- provide a name for allowing system wide overrides for aliases
  (/etc/transcript/aliases.txt?) The simple way would be to include
  /etc/transcript in the search path, but that would also mean we will try to
  load modules from there which is not what we want.

LOW PRIORITY
============
- perhaps an iconv like A to B converter with better semantics and better
  performance (through multiple conversions at a time) should be provided as
  well
- should TRANSCRIPT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_USE impact the from_unicode conversion as well?

RELEASE ENGINEERING
===================
- testing for
	- HAS_INLINE
	- HAS_NL_LANGINFO
	- HAS_STRDUP
	- USE_ENDIAN
	- USE_GETTEXT (don't forget to set LOCALEDIR! see dwdiff Makefile.dist.in)
- provide translations
- set the copyright years correctly
