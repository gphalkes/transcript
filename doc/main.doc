@section Introduction

The libcharconv library provides functions for converting between different
character sets and Unicode. The library allows great control over the
conversions. It was designed for use in programs which use Unicode internally,
and can encode Unicode in UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32/UCS-4.
