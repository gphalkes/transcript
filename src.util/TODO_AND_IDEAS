- figure out what is the best block size for the flags trie. It may well be
  different than what we have now.
- if the subchar or subchar1 don't map to anything, they should be automatically
  mapped to the replacement char (FFFD)
- implement find_by_codepoint and find_by_codepage_bytes which should in some
  cases also look in variants. Also a precision indicator must be added such
  that only some precisions match (bitmap)
- use equal in comparisons more often, instead of manual for loop.

- check out the following error:
ibm-ucm/aix-IBM_udcJP-4.3.6.ucm: State machine specifies byte sequences shorter than <mb_cur_min>


- allow extra initial states only if the MULTIBYTE_START_STATE_1 flag is also
  set
- The following checks have to be implemented:
	- for each |3 fallback there is at least a |0 mapping as well
	- for each |1 fallback there is at least a |0 mapping as well
	- the above must hold for variants as well
	- the subchar and subchar1 characters may not appear in variants for
		to_unicode mappings.
