- figure out what is the best block size for the flags trie. It may well be
  different than what we have now.

- check out the following error:
ibm-ucm/aix-IBM_udcJP-4.3.6.ucm: State machine specifies byte sequences shorter than <mb_cur_min>


- allow extra initial states only if the MULTIBYTE_START_STATE_1 flag is also
  set
- The following checks have to be implemented:
	- for each |3 fallback there is at least a |0 mapping as well
	- for each |1 fallback there is at least a |0 mapping as well
	- the above must hold for variants as well
	- the subchar and subchar1 characters may not appear in variants for
		to_unicode mappings.

Conversion issues:
- fullwidth to half-width fallbacks and vice-versa
- what to do with the mu versus micro sign? In latin-1 the character is the mu
  sign, but when then converting to code page 437 we have a problem (if we consider
  that the mu in there is the greek letter).
  See the wikipedia page on code page 437: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepage_437
  especially the section on "Multiple-meaning character glyphs". In case of the
  micro sign, I think choosing the micro sign is best because it maps best to
  latin-1, and everyone else is doing that as well. The others are less relevant.
  We could add 03B5 -> E6 as fallback.
