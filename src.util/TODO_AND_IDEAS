- figure out what is the best block size for the flags trie. It may well be
  different than what we have now. Maybe it's different for each number of
  bits saved. This is not a problem because it can be hard-coded in each of the
  different routines in state_table_converter.c
- check names in different UCM sets against each other for clashes
- check names for normalization clashes
- loops in states cause a segementation fault!

- check out the following error:
ibm-ucm/aix-IBM_udcJP-4.3.6.ucm: State machine specifies byte sequences shorter than <mb_cur_min>


- allow extra initial states only if the MULTIBYTE_START_STATE_1 flag is also
  set
- The following checks have to be implemented:
	- for each |3 fallback there is at least a |0 mapping as well
	- for each |1 fallback there is at least a |0 mapping as well
	- the above must hold for variants as well
	- the subchar and subchar1 characters may not appear in variants for
		to_unicode mappings.
