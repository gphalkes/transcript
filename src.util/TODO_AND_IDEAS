- add trie storage for flags, as they contain large blocks of similar data.
  This should reduce file size significantly. Even a single level trie would
  help greatly.
- if we use zlib/lzo for compression, then we can optimize our tables for
  in-memory size. This makes the state machine minimization easier. On the
  other hand, that would introduce a dependency which we may want to avoid, and
  disk space is not expensive.
- perhaps it is a good idea to save the data such that we can simply use a
  read-only mmap and a small set of pointers into the file.
- allow extra initial states only if the MULTIBYTE_START_STATE_1 flag is also set
