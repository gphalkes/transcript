- if we use zlib/lzo for compression, then we can optimize our tables for
  in-memory size. This makes the state machine minimization easier. On the
  other hand, that would introduce a dependency which we may want to avoid, and
  disk space is not expensive.
- perhaps it is a good idea to save the data such that we can simply use a
  read-only mmap and a small set of pointers into the file.
- allow extra initial states only if the MULTIBYTE_START_STATE_1 flag is also set

Conversion issues:
- fullwidth to half-width fallbacks and vice-versa
- what to do with the mu versus micro sign? In latin-1 the character is the mu
  sign, but when then converting to code page 437 we have a problem (if we consider
  that the mu in there is the greek letter).
  See the wikipedia page on code page 437: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepage_437
  especially the section on "Multiple-meaning character glyphs". In case of the
  micro sign, I think choosing the micro sign is best because it maps best to
  latin-1, and everyone else is doing that as well. The others are less relevant.
  We could add 03B5 -> E6 as fallback.
